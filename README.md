# TEXT-TECHNOLOGIES-FOR-DATA-SCIENCE

### Course Outline

Syllabus:
\* Introduction to IR and text processing, system components
\* Zipf, Heaps, and other text laws
\* Pre-processing: tokenization, normalisation, stemming, stopping.
\* Indexing: inverted index, boolean and proximity search
\* Evaluation methods and measures (e.g., precision, recall, MAP, significance testing).
\* Query expansion
\* IR toolkits and applications
\* Ranked retrieval and learning to rank
\* Text classification: feature extraction, baselines, evaluation
\* Web search



##### Learning Outcomes

On successful completion of this course, you should be able to: 

1. build basic search engines from scratch, and use IR tools for searching massive collections of text documents

2. build feature extraction modules for text classification

3. implement evaluation scripts for IR and text classification

4. understand how web search engines (such as Google) work

5. work effectively in a team to produce working systems
